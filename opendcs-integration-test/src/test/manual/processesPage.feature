  As a user of the OpenDCS Web Client
  I want to work in the Processes page
  So that I can create, retrieve, update and delete process data

  Background:
    Given I am successfully logged into the OpenDCS Web Client
    And I am on the Processes page

      | Actions   |

  Scenario Outline: Sorting rows in the Processes page
    When I click on the double arrow button on the <Column> columnn
    And the button for the <Column> column changes to an up arrow button
    Then the rows in the Processes page should be sorted in ascending order based on the content in the <Column> column
    When I click on the up arrow button
    Then the rows in the Processes page should be sorted in descending order based on the content in the <Column> column
